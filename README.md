# Fire & Gas Leak Detection System üî•üö®

## Project Overview
Garment factories require proactive fire prevention systems to ensure safety. This project develops a **multi-sensor IoT network** (temperature, gas, smoke sensors) integrated with **computer vision** to detect hazards and trigger evacuation protocols. The system performs real-time threat analysis using a Random Forest classifier and YOLOv10 for vision-based detection.


## Features
- **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Combines temperature, humidity, gas, and smoke sensors for comprehensive hazard detection.
- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes YOLOv10s for flame and smoke detection from live webcam or uploaded videos.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Analyzes sensor data to predict threat levels.
- **Combined Prediction**: Merges sensor and vision predictions for accurate hazard assessment.
- **Flask Web App**: Provides a dashboard to display input parameters, predictions, and live video processing results.
- **Synthetic Sensor Data**: Simulates real-world sensor data for demonstration purposes due to hardware limitations.
